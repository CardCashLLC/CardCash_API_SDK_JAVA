## Usage

You need to import the `CardCash_API` library

You need to initialize a new API class `API(string appID, Boolean isProduction = false, Boolean debug = false)`

To Create new connection to sandbox:
```CC_API = new API(appID, false, false);```

To Create new connection to production:
```CC_API = new API(appID, true, false);```

To debug CardCash Cookies with CardCash help:
```CC_API = new API(appID, false, true);```

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALWAYS START WITH A `CUSTOMER LOGIN` CALL - YOU CAN'T GET YOUR MERCHANT PRICING, SAVE YOUR CART, OR PLACE A ORDER WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN!

`CC_API.CustomerLogin(emailAddr, pwd);`
